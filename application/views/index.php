                                    With the technology of today, almost anything is possible. So with a country
                                    where almost everyone rides a bicycle (The Netherlands) we were thinking to take
                                    all the good stuff from technology and put it into a bicycle.</strong>
                                    </p>

                                BiKE is a bicycle with many, many features like:</br>
                                - Navigation</br>
                                - Weather Forecast</br>
                                - Music Player</br>
                                - Tire Pressure Gauge</br>
                                - TITEL HIERRR</br>
                                - Heartrate Monitor</br>
                                - Breakdown Assistance</br>
                                </br>
                                The little display on your handlebar is a low-powered display that is self-configurable. It can show up to 4 different features in short info messages. The detailed info can be found on your smartphone. Which is connected via Bluetooth with BiKE. And to make everything better, we made VOiCE. So that the user experience is as best as it could be.</br>
                                Now do not worry, we will explain all the features down below.

After it is set the display on your BiKE automaticly will show the directions you need to go. But just with arrows and meters. It is important that your smartphone stays in your pocket while cycling. That is because it is alot safer. You can always watch the detailed info about the route during your break on your smartphone.</br>

                                The Music part is actually pretty simple too. With your Bluetooth connection, your music on your phone is automaticly synced with BiKE. Just go ahead and make a nice headbanging playlist in the BiKE app and you are ready to go.

So if you're losing your air alot faster than it should be, You will still have a flat tire, it only is'nt a surprise anymore.

                                When your BiKE breaks down, just open the app and go to breakdown assistance. The app then shows cycle repairers near you who can fix your bike! You can call them to pick you up, or if they're close you can get there yourself. We are waiting for you with some fresh soda. (Or hot coco in the winter).

                                We are students at SintLucas Eindhoven and our study is called: MediaDevelopment. This website serves as a conceptual project that is siliconvalley worthy. At least, that was the exercise. So we decided to make BiKE. We are located in Holland and bicycles are our thing, next to windmills, clogs and green plants. But there aren't many bicycles with the technology of today. There are, but we wanted more, we wanted everything in a bicycle that you want, as user. That created BiKE.</br>
